ORM
	mapping of objects onto the database

Configuration
	requires a configuration file hibernate.config.xml
	requires classes that need to be mapped

ServiceRegistry 
	built using the configuration object and service registry builder

hibernate.config.xml
	u need to specify driver classname ,url,username,password adn also dialect to indicate which rdbms language u are using 
	<hibernate-configuration>
		<session-factory>	
			<property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class">driverclassname</property>
			<property name="hibernate.connection.url">url</property>
			<property name="hibernate.connection.username">username</property>
			<property name="hibernate.connection.password">password</property>
			<property name="hibernate.connection.dialect">dialect</property>
			<property name="hbm2ddl.auto">create</property>  //create a new table every time update will create only if not present
		</session-factory>
	</hibernate-configuration>

SessionFactory
	created using configuration and using the service registry object

Session
	created using session factory

Transaction
	required while performing operations that might alter the contents of the table

@Entity
	to annotate a class to be mapped to a table

@Id
	to annotate a variable to be used as primary key for the table

@Table
	naming a table using this

@Column
	change column properties

@Transient
	data that will not be stored in db

<property name="hibernate.show_sql">true</property>			//to show sql query being used internally in the running terminal


@Embedded
	annotate a class to make its fields as embeddable in another class


@OneToOne
	creates a foreign key in declared table
@OneToMany(mappedBy="variablename")//incase extra table is created for mapping u can stop that by specifying in this the name of the variable of the entity in which the relation would be mapped
	creates a new table on behalf of the table in which its declared
@ManyToMany
	creates table for each table in which it is declared
creation of multiple tables can be avoided by using the mappedBy property
