u r in branch main and u have remote and local m  remote is the file at git remote and local is the file at local
u have pulled remote and nbow have made changfes to the remote but local remains the same now u make changes to local now  u try to push local now u cant do it
as remote contains content not present in local


if u are in a brach and u have some extra content compared to that branch and u try to pull from main then u can either kee-p the content of u or main or u could merge
in merge it provides u the option to merge content of 2 branches

if u have 3 branches the main ,branch 1 and branch2 now if u make seperate changes to branch 1 and branch 2 the u could merge branch1 and main the u could merge main and branch2
and it will give u prompt to keep which contents and the u can have both branches contebnts merged in main
