create entity manager factory using the persistance class

using entity manager factory create a entity manager

then using entity manager perform database operations

annotate the class as entity and also annotate the id

use javax class

place it under resources/META-INF folder

create a db and also a table in database

@Query can be used for mentioning ur own queries for methods in jpaRepository

@Modifying can beb used for creating sql stateemnts which modify the table such as delete has to be used in combination with @Query and also annotate with @Transactional
@Transactional
@Modying
@Query(value="mention query here",nativeQuery=true)


    @Transactional
    @Modifying
    @Query(value = "delete from employee e where e.city=?1",nativeQuery = true)
    void deleteByCity(String city);



@NamedNativeQuery(name = "Employee.findByNameandCity",query ="select * from employee  where name=?1 and city=?2",resultClass = Employee.class)
useful for mentioning queries along with the entity and can create a method with the same name in jparepositiory which can be directly called


@OneToOne
can be both unidirectinal and bidirectional 
in unidirectional u create the foreign key which references the primary key of the other table
in bidirectional u apply the relation ship in both tables
u can also use mapped by if u have created variables for foreign key in both classes like bidirectional


//for data format exception
while using bidirectional relationships use
@JsonBackReference on the variable which will not map
@JsonManagedReference on variable which will map
u also need to mention the mapped by
and @JsonIgnore on variable which is used for mapping

to change server port in spring boot add server.port=port number


RestTemplate can just act as a client and just accept the data from server just like postman and also send data to server


@OneToOne here one entity of A is related to atmost one entity of b so u would require a foreign key in either A or B

@OneToOne(mappedBy=)   spcify mapped by if bidirectional
@JoinColumn()specify the name of the column which would be used as foreign key mention this over the varibale of entity which is going to have the foreign key


@OneToMany  one column of A is related to multiple columns of B
@ManyToOne multiple columns of A are related to one column of B

if one to many from A then B needs to have the foreign key so use mapped by in A and and specify the join column tag in B

@ManyToMany 
multiple records of A are related to multiple records of B
a new table has to be created with 2 foreign keys from both A and B
specify the tag over variables of both entities and specify @JoinTable to specify name and other properties of table and mapped by to specify which entity is responsible to create the table




@OneToOne
using in both entities can create foreign key columns in both tables
using in both entities but mentioning in one mappedBy the other can create a foreign key in only the entity in which mappedBy is not mentioned
if used in only one table then foreign key will  be created in the mentioned table

@OneToMany  && @ManyToOne
using in just one entity creates a new table where u have the primary key of mentioned tables as foreign key and primary key of other table as primary key

if @OneToMany and @ManyToOne is mentioned then @OneToMany will create a table with 2 foreign keys and @ManyToOne will add a foreign key to the used table

using mappedby in @OneToMany will create a foreign key column in the other table


@ManyToMany
using in just one entity will create a table with 2 foreign keys
using in both entities will create 2 similar tables with 2 foreign keys
using mapped by in any one will create a single table with 2 foreign keys
